------------HELPFUL EXPLANATION DOCUMENT FOR SUPER CHILL TA ONLY--------------------

So, this week I was able to implement most of what I said that I would last week.
My proposal has been updated. Take a look at that as well!

You will notice there are very few additional tests. 
This is because I relied on improving my manual test plan. 

However, I did fix the robot tests completely this week, so you can run that to verify
that it works correctly.

Also, please read the manual test plan, as it will help you open and run 
my code correcly if you want to see the results of my labor. 

I'm very proud of what I did this week, although I wasn't able to implement things in exactly the way that you have mentioned it to me.

Mario is constantly colliding with the ground because I need a condition
to check against for falls that are not preceded by jumps, like when you
fall off a ledge. This was a design decision.

I am able to check multiple collisions at once, by storing all of the
collisions for a moving block in a vector of CollisionTypes, which I defined myself.
This may be slow, but it is only applied to moving enemies, so I don't think it's 
a huge deal. 

Also, did you know this is running at 50 frames per second? I've never played Mario
like this.

It took an extreme amount of effort to get collision detection working exactly correctly.
I found that I was getting stuck inside bricks, falling through the ground, getting array 
index exceptions. It was a mess, but I fixed it!

Also, gravity was not the easiest. I plan to improve that later. 
You will notice that the jumps are very high. Mario looks like a mosquito or something! 
However, this does at least resemble the parabolic pattern of a jump. 

Overall, I put a lot of effort into this. I hope it is satisfying!
